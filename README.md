## 🧭 About Me

I'm **John Munn** — a systems thinker, full-stack builder, and creative leader who turns complexity into clarity.

With over 20 years in software development, I’ve built scalable platforms, mentored engineering teams, and helped organizations evolve their technical vision. I believe leadership is as much about listening and alignment as it is about architecture and execution.

Currently at **resulta**, I focus on building systems that empower people — from high-performing dev teams to platforms designed for growth.  
I also write, mentor, and design fantasy stories that explore real-world leadership challenges.

> *“Build systems that outlast people, and people who outgrow systems.”*
