## üß≠ About Me

Throughout my career, I've built scalable platforms that significantly improved developer velocity, platform stability, and end-user engagement. I‚Äôve mentored engineering teams through phases of rapid growth, platform transformation, and capability scaling‚Äîhelping them deliver solutions that are not only technically sound, but strategically aligned.

I firmly believe that effective leadership is rooted in active listening, strong alignment, and the empowerment of others. 

Currently at Resulta, my focus is on building systems that empower people while driving long-term business value and strategic advantage. I am particularly passionate about leveraging AI to augment developer workflows and rethinking platform architecture around modular, composable systems. I‚Äôm also a strong advocate for clear and effective communication‚Äîusing writing, storytelling, and worldbuilding to explore leadership principles and spark innovation within the teams I support.

> *‚ÄúBuild systems that outlast people, and people who outgrow systems.‚Äù*
